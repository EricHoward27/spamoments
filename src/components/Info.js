                <div className="col-lg-4 ml-auto"><p className="lead">1. Find out what your skin type is. If you are not certain, it is worth visiting a skin care specialist like me just to find out, because the great majority of skin care products are for a specific skin type.<br />
                2. Drink about two liters (three and a half pints) of water every day. Water flushes toxins out of your body and toxins or poisons are undeniably better ou than in. Drinking lots of water will help keep you healthy inside, which 
                should be reflected outside.<br />
                3. Wash your skin at least once and preferably twice every day. It could be more often depending on your job and the climate. The most essential shower is the one when you get in at the end of the day, so that the day's 
                pollution, grime and dust do not have all night to get into your pores. Hot and cold water are not particularly good for skin, so luke warm water and mild soap are best.<br />
                4. Do no use many chemicals on your skin. Exfoliate OR Maske, but do not rub hard and not every day; Try a few home-made skin care products and see if they have the desired result for you, (Call me to discuss as I have some great ideas!)<br />
                5. Never let your skin dry out. Dry skin is more likely to crack and allow bacteria to get in. Apply moisturizer once a day after a shower when your skin is still moist. </p></div>
                <div className="col-lg-4 mr-auto"><p className="lead">6. Use only mild, non-perfumed cleansers. (Never Soap). Soaps are Alkaline and will strip the natural oils from your skin. Also include a toner or astringent to balance the PH back to it’s original state. 
                (Don’t forget to Moisturize the Skin with a good moisturizer)<br />
                7. Shield your skin from the ravages of the sun&#39;s UV rays. UV light is bad for skin and is also a major cause of cancer. Some moisturizers contain a mild form of sunblock (SPF 15 or 30),
                so you could rub on one of those before going out every day.<br />
                8. Exercise and sleep as much as you are able. Exercise is excellent for your whole body including your skin and internal organs. Exercise stretches your skin this way and that, keeping it taut, smoothing out wrinkles and sags. Sleep 
                is indispensable for the mind and allows your muscles and skin to relax properly. 6 to 8 hours of sleep is needed to maintain proper body functions.<br />
                9. Be prudent with skin problems like acne or dermatitis. If you do not know what you are doing, seek advice, because you may do more harm than good. (I am available)<br />
                10. Lower your stress whenever you get the opportunity. Take time out to pamper yourself, a massage or a sauna. Relax by watching a film or reading a book is also good.</p></div>
